# Hi! I'm Nathaniel Ortiz.
### I'm a fourth year electrical engineering student at the University of California, Riverside.

I'm very passionate about electrical engineering, especially Signal Processing and RF. I also have extensive experience with embedded systems.

## Current Projects
I am currently a part of two projects, one led by a team of undergraduate students, and another led by a postdoc doing research.

### Saru
[Saru](https://sarurecycling.com/) is a student-led initiative to incentivize recycling. We aim to design a machine that automatically identifies, sorts, and incentivizes the user to recycle more. We do this by immediately providing a cash refund to the user when they recycle.

I'm currently leading the electrical and software development for this project. We are currently building a prototype, with testing scheduled to begin Q2 2021 at Goodwin's Organics, a grocery store in Riverside, CA.

We hope to provide a quick, easy to use recycling machine that pushes and motivates people to recycle.

Saru was recently accepted into Blackstone's Launchpad fellowship. We are also a Top 7 finalist with Blackstone Launchpad's startup grind. You can also [connect with us on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/saru-recycling/about/).

**UCR STUDENTS:** We are looking for CS/CE majors who are interested in our venture, in order to further develop our internal software and object recognition. If you have experience with embedded systems, full stack development, and/or ML/object recognition, please contact me via email or connect with me on LinkedIn.

### DoD Research Center
[The DoD Center of Excellence](https://news.ucr.edu/articles/2020/10/02/uc-riverside-receives-75-million-improve-large-scale-networked-systems) at UCR was established during Winter 2021. I am currently working with [Dr. Yingbo Hua](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=RD6AdlcAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao), primarily researching digital communication methods and compression methods.

## Previous Projects

### UC LIGHT
[UC LIGHT](https://www.uclight.ucr.edu/), or the Ubiquitous Communication by Light center, is a research team led by [Dr. Albert Wang](https://intra.ece.ucr.edu/~aw/) at the department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of California, Riverside.

My team, led by postdoc [Dr. Tian Lang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=blB4mfYAAAAJ&hl=en), is developing a system for communication using visible light inside hospitals. Due to hospital's strict requirements and limits on RF emissions, we are working to develop a user-tracking system that works exclusively with the pre-existing lightbulbs already installed in the ceiling. 

Our paper, *Integrated Design of Low Complexity RSS Based Visible Light Indoor Positioning and Power-Line Communication System for Smart Hospitals*, was recently accepted to IEEE ICCE 2021.

I am working on the powerline communication team, to allow the lights to communicate with the user-tracking system. Once development is finished, a user will be able to pinpoint the relative location of a person in a room, with no RF transmitted.

## Other Information

### Programming Languages
I mostly program in C, C++, Python, and MATLAB, depending on the use case. I am also familiar with git, Bash, Verilog, PSpice, LTspice, KiCad, and Altium.

### Embedded Systems
I have developed on AVR, PIC, Raspberry Pi, ARM Cortex M4, and Cypress PSoC embedded microcontrollers, mostly in C and Python with small portions of assembly.

## About Me
I'm lived in Riverside County my whole life, mainly residing here in Riverside for school, and Indio during my childhood. In my free time, I enjoy playing tennis, listening to Weezer, and configuring my personal servers. I am also an amateur radio operator; my callsign is K7WZR. You can find me on 2M and 70CM with my Icom 4100A.
