# Hi! I'm Nathaniel Ortiz.
### I'm a third year electrical engineering student at the University of California, Riverside.

I'm very passionate about electrical engineering, especially Signal Processing and RF. I also have extensive experience with embedded systems.

## Current Projects
I am currently a part of two projects, one led by a team of undergraduate students, and another led by a postdoc doing research.

### SARU
SARU is a student-led initiative to incentivize recycling. We aim to design a machine that automatically identifies, sorts, and incentivizes the user to recycle more. We do this by immediately providing a cash refund to the user when they recycle.

I'm currently leading the electrical and software development for this project. We are currently building a prototype, with testing scheduled to begin on UCR's campus sometime this summer.

We hope to provide a quick, easy to use recycling machine that pushes and motivates people to recycle.

### UC LIGHT
[UC LIGHT](https://www.uclight.ucr.edu/), or the Ubiquitous Communication by Light center, is a research team lead by Dr. Albert Wang at the department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of California, Riverside.

My team, led by postdoc Tian Lang, is developing a system for communication using visible light inside hospitals. Due to hospital's strict requirements and limits on RF emissions, we are working to develop a user-tracking system that works exclusively with the pre-existing lightbulbs already installed in the ceiling. 

I am working on the powerline communication team, to allow the lights to communicate with the user-tracking system. Once development is finished, a user will be able to pinpoint the relative location of a person in a room, with no RF transmitted.

The National Science Foundation Award is #1838702.

## Other Information

### Programming Languages
C, C++, Python, and MATLAB are my tools of choice depending on what I am working on. I'm also familiar with Git, Bash, Verilog, and PSpice. 

### Embedded Systems
I have developed on AVR, PIC, Raspberry Pi, ARM Cortex M4, and Cypress PSoC embedded microcontrollers, mostly in C with small portions of Assembly.

## About Me
I'm lived in Riverside County my whole life, mainly residing here in Riverside for school, and Indio during my childhood. In my free time, I enjoy playing tennis, listening to Weezer, and configuring my personal servers. I am also an amateur radio operator; my callsign is K7WZR. You can find me on 2M and 70CM with my Icom 4100A.
